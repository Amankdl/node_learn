1. Never upload node_modules folder to git (it will consume time).
2. If node_module is not available than run command 'npm init'.
3. Positioning of app.use (midlleware) is impt. It must be at last of all routes if we are handling 404.html page through it.
4. Register template engine just after requiring express.
5. To send data into ejs template just pass a js object with file name in app.js like :-

        app.get('/about', (req, res)=>{
            res.render('about', {title : 'About'});
        });
        
6. To define variables in ejs template --> <% variable_name = "value" %>        
7. To print variables in ejs template --> <%= variable_name%>       
8. To include any partial component <%- include('./../partials/nav.ejs')  %> 
9. We can have multiple middlewares but order of middleware is very impt in node.
10. Files publically not available to users. Ex: we can not access to 
        www.abc.com/style.css or www.abc.com/aman.jpg
    If we tries to access above links than we will get 404.
    To make such files available we need to create a folder with name public (or with any other name but than we have to 
    mention it explicitly in url.)
    -> For adding external css we need this.
    app.use(express.static('public'));

11. app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}));  --> this middleware is required to handle POST body data.
